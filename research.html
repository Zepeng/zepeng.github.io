                <li><strong>Assistant Project Scientist, UCSD (June 2023 - Present)</strong>
                    <p>Characterization of nEXO charge readout cold electronics and development of low radioactivity and low outgassing nEXO charge readout system. Achieved the first full function in-LXe characterization of CRYO ASIC for nEXO charge readout and studied mitigation of xenon boiling from ASIC power with pressurized Xe chamber. Developed machine learning algorithms for EXO-200 and nEXO data analyses. Designed and built a cryogenic probe for Barium trapping with xenon ice and capacitive xenon ice sensor. Developed sub-keV threshold liquid xenon detector for detection of coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering. Analysis coordinator of EXO-200 experiment since Oct 2022.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher, UCSD (Oct 2021 - May 2023)</strong>
                    <p>Developed machine learning algorithms for the JUNO experiment. Took a leading role in the analysis of diffuse supernova neutrino search in the JUNO experiment. Characterized SiPMs and readout electronics at cryogenic temperatures for JUNO-TAO experiment, characterized the charge readout tiles and analogy multiplexing charge ASIC for the nEXO experiment and developed combined readout of charge with the charge readout tile and photon readout with SiPMs in a small xenon TPC.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Postdoctoral Associate, Yale (Jun 2017 - Nov 2020)</strong>
                    <p>Developed simulation of charge readout in the nEXO experiment and development of machine learning algorithms of event discrimination using the charge signals. Led MC production and machine learning event classification for the reanalysis of nEXO sensitivity. Designed and constructed a xenon cryogenic system to study the electronegative impurities and their effect on the electron lifetime in liquid xenon. Designed and constructed a material outgassing rate measurement to study the outgassing rate of materials in vacuum. Led the analysis of Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay search with EXO-200 dataset that provides the most stringent limits to-date on the Majoron-emitting decays of 136Xe.</p>
